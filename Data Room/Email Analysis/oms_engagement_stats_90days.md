## Key Insights

1. **Overall book rate is 10.8%** - aligns with your 10-14% benchmark
2. **Response rate is only 20.7%** - 79% of requests get no supplier response
3. **Top performers (Equipment Share, Continental Lift)** have 60-90%+ book rates
4. **Several high-volume suppliers have 0% response** - likely deliverability issues or wrong contacts
5. **28.8% cancellation rate** is high - worth investigating why

---

## Recommended Actions

1. **Check deliverability** for 0% response suppliers (Stanmore, Stephenson's, Torcan, etc.)
2. **Update contacts** for geographic accounts (Texas, California, Florida, Kentucky)
3. **Onboard top performers to OMS** - they're already engaged, automation would help
4. **Investigate high cancellation rate** (28.8%)
