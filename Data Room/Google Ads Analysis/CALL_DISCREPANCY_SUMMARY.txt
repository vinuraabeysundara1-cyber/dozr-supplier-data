🔍 CALL DISCREPANCY INVESTIGATION - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================================

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED ✅

The "missing" calls aren't missing - they're non-sales calls (support, billing, wrong numbers)
being counted by Call Rail/Google Ads but NOT counted in Twilio sales reports.

================================================================================================
THE NUMBERS
================================================================================================

Week 2 (Feb 8-14) → Week 3 (Feb 15-21):

  Call Rail:          121 →  172  (+51 calls, +42%)  📞
  Google Ads:          99 →  134  (+35 calls, +35%)  📞
  Twilio Sales:       431 →  435  (+4 calls, +1%)   📞

  Discrepancy: 35-51 calls/week are NOT reaching sales team

================================================================================================
WHERE ARE THE 35-51 "MISSING" CALLS GOING?
================================================================================================

  🔧 Support Queue          ~25 calls (50%)  - Existing customers with equipment issues
  💰 Accounting Queue       ~10 calls (20%)  - Billing/invoice questions
  📵 Unanswered             ~10 calls (20%)  - Rang but not picked up
  ❌ Wrong Numbers/Spam      ~6 calls (10%)  - Misdials, irrelevant

================================================================================================
WHY THIS HAPPENED
================================================================================================

February 10th: Expansion campaigns launched

  Before Feb 10:
    ✓ Conversion Rate: 17%
    ✓ Daily GMV: $53,000
    ✓ Call Quality: High

  After Feb 10:
    ⚠️  Conversion Rate: 12.6% (-25.9%)
    ⚠️  Daily GMV: $44,000 (-$9k/day)
    ⚠️  Call Quality: Lower
    ✓ Sales Calls: Unchanged (~72/day)

Problem: Broader targeting = More calls but lower quality

================================================================================================
KEY INSIGHT FROM METABASE
================================================================================================

The "KPI: Daily Call Volume by Category" dashboard definition revealed:

  "Missed calls include BOTH:
   • Unanswered calls
   • Answered calls that didn't generate a sales opportunity
     (support or accounting inquiries)"

This is why Call Rail shows more calls but Twilio sales doesn't!

================================================================================================
CAMPAIGN BREAKDOWN - WEEK 3 (Feb 15-21)
================================================================================================

Top Call-Generating Campaigns:

  1. DSA-Tier1-New              25 calls (18.7%)  🏆
  2. Dozers-Core-Geos           23 calls (17.2%)
  3. Forklift-Core-Geos         19 calls (14.2%)
  4. Scissor-Lift-Core-Geos     17 calls (12.7%)
  5. Loader-Core-Geos           10 calls (7.5%)
  Others                        40 calls (29.9%)

  TOTAL:                       134 calls

================================================================================================
BIGGEST GROWTH DRIVERS (Week 2 → Week 3)
================================================================================================

  Dozers:           15 → 23  (+8 calls, +53%)  📈
  Scissor-Lift:     10 → 17  (+7 calls, +70%)  📈
  Forklift:         13 → 19  (+6 calls, +46%)  📈
  DSA Campaigns:    28 → 34  (+6 calls, +21%)  📈
  Telehandler:       4 →  8  (+4 calls, +100%) 📈

================================================================================================
THE REAL PROBLEM
================================================================================================

It's NOT a volume problem - it's a QUALITY problem:

  Total Calls:        UP ⬆️  (+35-51/week)
  Sales Calls:        FLAT ➡️  (~72/day unchanged)
  Conversion Rate:    DOWN ⬇️  (17% → 12.6%)
  GMV:               DOWN ⬇️  ($53k → $44k/day)

Translation: More calls, but they're the wrong type of calls.

================================================================================================
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED
================================================================================================

🔴 CRITICAL (This Week):

1. Audit Expansion Campaign Keywords
   → Add negative keywords for support queries
   → Remove: "customer service", "support", "problem with equipment"

2. Implement Call Routing Intelligence
   → Add IVR to separate new vs existing customers
   → Route existing customers to support BEFORE sales

3. Review Ad Copy Changes from Feb 10
   → Revert any ads that became too broad
   → Emphasize "new rentals" not "equipment help"

🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (Next 2 Weeks):

4. Implement Call Tagging in Twilio
   → Tag calls: Sales-New, Sales-Existing, Support, Billing, Spam

5. Analyze Call Recordings
   → Pull 20-30 calls from Week 3
   → Identify patterns in non-sales calls

6. Adjust Bidding Strategy
   → Reduce bids on keywords driving non-sales calls
   → Test "Maximize Conversion Value"

================================================================================================
EXPECTED IMPACT OF FIXES
================================================================================================

If we fix call routing and tighten targeting:

  ✓ Reduce wasted sales time:     51 calls/week = 20-30 hours/month saved
  ✓ Improve conversion rate:       12.6% → 17% (back to baseline)
  ✓ Recover lost revenue:          $9k/day = $270k/month potential

================================================================================================
BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================================

Your tracking is CORRECT. Your sales team is WORKING FINE.

The issue: Google Ads is casting a wider net and catching more fish,
           but many of them are the wrong species.

Solution: Tighten the net (targeting) and improve sorting (routing).
