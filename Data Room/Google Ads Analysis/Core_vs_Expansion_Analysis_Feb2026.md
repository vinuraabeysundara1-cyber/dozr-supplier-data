## 8. Recommendations

### Short-term (Next 7 days)
1. **Continue running expansion campaigns** - They're still in learning phase
2. **Follow up on the 8 quotes** - Check CRM status with sales team
3. **Monitor CPA daily** - Feb 12 was $70, Feb 13 spiked to $96
4. **Don't pause ad groups yet** - Give algorithm more time to optimize

### Decision Point (Feb 21 - Day 10)
- If deals/purchases start closing → Scale up expansion
- If quotes continue but no deals → Pipeline issue, not ads issue
- If quote volume drops → Consider restructuring or pausing

### Budget Consideration
- Current expansion spend: ~$400-800/day
- Set a maximum "learning investment" threshold (e.g., $4,000 total)
- The $1,800 already spent is algorithm learning data - don't waste it
