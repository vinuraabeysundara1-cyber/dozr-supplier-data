# Canadian Google Ads Campaign Pause
**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Prepared by:** Claude Code

---

## Summary

We've paused 7 of our 9 Canadian campaigns for the winter season. With lower demand during this time of year, we were seeing spend without the conversion volume to justify it. Only 2 campaigns were driving meaningful results, so we're focusing budget there until conditions improve.

## Still Running (2 Campaigns)

- **Brand** - Capturing branded search traffic
- **Loader** - Best performing equipment category in Canada

## Paused Until Spring (7 Campaigns)

- Scissor Lift
- Excavator
- Telehandler
- Boom Lift
- Dozers
- Forklift
- Tractor

---

## Rationale

Based on last 30 days of data:

- Lower winter demand in Canada
- Spend was not converting at acceptable rates
- Brand and Loader campaigns were the only ones driving meaningful results
- Conserving budget for spring reactivation when demand picks back up

## Next Steps

1. Monitor Brand and Loader campaigns through winter
2. Reactivate paused campaigns in spring (March/April timeframe)
3. Review performance data before reactivation to set appropriate budgets
