### Strategic Recommendations

#### 1. Scale DSA Investment (Priority: HIGH)

**Action:** Increase DSA budget from $7k to $12-15k/month
- Current: $7,059/month generating $61,468 value
- Projected: $15k/month could generate $130k+ value at current ROAS
- Risk: Low (proven performance over 3 months)

**Implementation:**
- Phase 1: Increase to $10k/month (Week 1)
- Phase 2: Increase to $12.5k/month (Week 3)
- Phase 3: Increase to $15k/month (Week 5)
- Monitor ROAS daily; pull back if drops below 6x

#### 2. Fix Monday Performance (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Issue:** Mondays deliver 1.77x ROAS vs 7.54x on Thursdays

**Potential Causes to Investigate:**
- Weekend lead accumulation creating Monday bottleneck
- Sales team availability/responsiveness on Mondays
- Ad scheduling issues (budget pacing)
- Competitor activity patterns

**Action Plan:**
- Analyze CallRail data for Monday call answer rates
- Review sales team Monday schedules
- Consider reducing Monday ad spend by 30%
- Reallocate budget to Thu/Wed

#### 3. Optimize/Pause Underperforming Expansion Campaigns (Priority: HIGH)

**Pause Immediately (0 calls, burning budget):**
- Excavator-Expansion: $492, 0 calls
- Telehandler-Expansion-2: $443, 0 calls

**Optimize or Reduce (generating calls but no deals):**
- Forklift-Expansion: $732, 9 calls, 0 deals
- Boom-Lift-Expansion: $694, 13 calls, 0 deals
- Scissor-Lift-Expansion: $670, 7 calls, 0 deals

#### 4. Replicate Week 1 Success (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Week 1 Analysis (Feb 2-8):**
- DSA delivered 19.64x ROAS
- Total 8 deals on $8,243 spend
- What was different about this week?

**Actions:**
- Review ad copy and landing pages used in Week 1

#### 5. Improve Conversion Funnel (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Current Metrics:**
- Call → Quote: 14.0%
- Quote → Deal: 49.2%
- Call → Deal: 6.9%

**Opportunities:**
- **Call → Quote** is the weak point (14%)
- DSA achieves 34.6% quote-to-deal vs 16.9% traditional
- Sales team training on DSA-type leads (high intent, specific needs)

**Action Plan:**
- Record and analyze high-converting calls
- Create playbook for handling specific equipment requests
- Implement lead scoring (DSA leads = higher priority)

#### 6. Continue DSA Expansion Testing (Priority: LOW)

**Current Status:**
- DSA-Expansion showing 5.71x ROAS
- Only 1 deal so far but promising

**Recommendation:**
- Continue running for 30 more days
- Budget: $500-750/month
