### Recommendations Per Campaign

#### 1. Dozers V3 — Scale Aggressively
- **Budget: $220 -> $400-500/day**
- **tROAS: 10.0 -> 8.0**
- Best campaign in the account. 59.1x ROAS today. CPC only $3.65. Missing 56.3% of impressions due to budget.

#### 2. Boom Lifts — Loosen tROAS
- **Budget: Keep $1,540**
- **tROAS: 5.7 -> 4.0**
- Spending only $450 of $1,540 budget. tROAS 5.7 is the chokehold. Algorithm pulled back after Feb 24's bad day.

#### 3. Boom Lifts Expansion — Increase Budget
- **Budget: $280 -> $500/day**
- 74.2% Budget Lost IS. Maxes budget daily. Delivered 46.1x ROAS on Feb 24.

#### 4. Forklift — Bump Budget
- **Budget: $400 -> $500/day**
- **tROAS: Keep 5.0**
- CPC improved -21%. All 5 RSAs rated EXCELLENT (no ad refresh needed). CTR drop is normal variance, not ad fatigue.

#### 5. DSA — Increase Budget
- **Budget: $517.50 -> $750/day**
- **tROAS: Keep 5.0**
- Clicks tripled (+161%) at -29% CPC. Strong ROAS (8.7x today, 16.6x yesterday).

#### 6. DSA Expansion — Double Budget
- **Budget: $98 -> $200/day**
- **tCPA: Keep $45**
- 66.2% Budget Lost IS. CPC only $4.53.

#### 7. Excavator — Monitor, Don't Change Yet
- **Budget: $250 -> $350/day**
- **Bidding: Keep uncapped Max Conv Value**
- CPC spiked to $12.20 (from ~$5) after Feb 25 ad changes. Give 5 days to stabilize. If CPC doesn't normalize by March 3, switch to Max Conversions with tCPA.
- Do NOT use tROAS: only ~16 value-bearing conversions (below 30 threshold).

#### 8. Loader US — Switch Bid Strategy
- **Budget: Keep $150**
- **Bidding: Max Conversions -> Max Conversion Value with tROAS 5.0**
- Generated $8,065 value on $86 spend today. Max Conversions treats a $0 phone call = $1,700 deal. Switch to value-based optimization.

#### 9. Dozers Expansion — Increase Budget
- **Budget: $46 -> $100/day**
- **tCPA: Keep $30**
- CPC only $2.50 (cheapest in account).

#### 10. Loader CA — Add CPC Guard
- **Budget: Keep $80**
- **Add tCPA $20**
- Had a $150 CPC click on Feb 24. Small Canadian market with volatile bidding.

#### 11-12. Brand US & Brand CA — No Changes
- Working as designed. IS at 96% and 95%.

## 5. Conversion Value Attribution — Key Insight

### How It Works
- **99% of conversion value** comes from offline uploads (Closed Won @ $1,700, Quote Requests @ $540)
- Values are **attributed BACK to the original click date** via GCLID
- Daily ROAS is unreliable — a day can show 0x then become 15x when deals upload

### Conversion Actions

| Action | Type | Default Value | Click Window | Attribution | Counting |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Calls from ads | Real-time | $1.00 | 30 days | Data-driven | Many/click |
| Phone Call | Offline upload | $1.00 | 30 days | Data-driven | Many/click |
| Qualified Calls | Offline upload | $50.00 | 30 days | Data-driven | One/click |
| Quote Requests | Offline upload | $540.00 | 30 days | Data-driven | Many/click |
| Closed Won | Offline upload | $1,700.00 | 30 days | Data-driven | Many/click |
| Purchase (GA4) | Real-time | Dynamic | 30 days | Data-driven | Many/click |

All conversion actions are marked as SECONDARY at account level (likely configured as campaign-level goals).

### Why tCPA Is Problematic
- tCPA counts ALL conversions equally: a $0 phone call = a $1,700 closed won deal
- Phone calls make up ~55% of total conversions but carry $0 value
- The algorithm would chase cheap phone calls to hit the target
- **Solution:** Either remove $0-value actions from campaign goals, or use Max Conversion Value (which weights by value)

## 6. Metrics Framework for Monitoring

### Daily (Leading Indicators)
1. **CPC** — cost per opportunity (down 20-38% on most campaigns)
2. **Click volume** — scaling signal
3. **CTR** — ad relevance
4. **Search Impression Share** — market capture
5. **Budget Lost IS** — scaling headroom

### Weekly (Pipeline)
1. Cost per Quote Request
2. Cost per Closed Won
3. Quote-to-Close rate
4. Average deal value

### Monthly (Strategic)
1. Rolling 14-day ROAS (smooths attribution noise)
2. Incrementality by campaign
3. New vs returning customer mix

### Critical: Upload offline conversions DAILY
- Current uploads happen with multi-day lag
- Google's algorithm needs timely conversion data for smart bidding
- Automating daily uploads is the #1 thing to improve ROAS consistency

| **Fix & Monitor** | Excavator, Loader CA | Stabilize before scaling |
| **Optimize Strategy** | Loader US | Switch to value-based bidding |
| **Maintain** | Brand US, Brand CA | No changes needed |
