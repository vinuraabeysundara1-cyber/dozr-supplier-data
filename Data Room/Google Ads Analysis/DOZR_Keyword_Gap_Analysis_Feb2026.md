## Revenue Impact Estimate

If we capture even 10% of the unaddressed GMV through proper keyword targeting:

| Gap | Unaddressed GMV | 10% Capture | 25% Capture |
|-----|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Forklift | $307,935 | $30,794 | $76,984 |
| Articulated Boom Lift | $160,054 | $16,005 | $40,014 |
| Scissor (size gaps) | ~$50,000 | $5,000 | $12,500 |
| **Total** | **$517,989** | **$51,799** | **$129,498** |

---

## Summary

The biggest opportunity is **Forklift** - generating $307K in GMV with ZERO Google Ads keyword coverage. Creating a dedicated Forklift campaign should be the top priority.

Second priority is **Articulated Boom Lift** - nearly $200K in GMV being lumped under generic "aerial lift" keywords that don't capture specific search intent.

These two gaps alone represent **$507K in GMV** that could be better captured with targeted keywords.
