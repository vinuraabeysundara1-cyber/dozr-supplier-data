## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Test mobile landing page experience**
   - Submit test quotes on iPhone and Android
   - Check if click-to-call button works
   - Verify page load speed

2. **Verify conversion tracking**
   - Check Google Tag Manager for errors
   - Verify conversion pixels are firing
   - Check for recent website changes

3. **Check phone system**
   - Are calls being answered?
   - Any IVR or routing changes?
   - Review call center staffing

### Short-term

4. **Review Google Analytics**
   - Compare bounce rates P1 vs P2
   - Check form submission completion rates
   - Look for 404 errors

5. **Consider pausing problem keywords**
   - "skid steer rental" - high spend, tanking CR
   - Generic "near me" terms with 0% conversion

---

## Conclusion

The conversion drop is NOT due to:
- Competition (impression share improved)
- Ad quality (CTR improved, CPC decreased)
- Sales team (close rates improved)

The problem IS:
- **Mobile landing page/form experience**
- **Phone call tracking/system**

The bottom of the funnel (quotes → closed deals) is performing better than before. Once you fix the top-of-funnel issues, conversions should recover.
