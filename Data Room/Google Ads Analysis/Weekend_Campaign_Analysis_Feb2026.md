| **Avg Deal Value** | $3,395 | TBD | TBD |

**Critical Insight:** Saturday's quote rate (18.8%) is **36% lower** than weekday average (29.1%).

**Possible Explanations:**

2. **Different customer profile** - More DIY/residential vs commercial weekday traffic
3. **Tracking lag** - Some quotes may not be uploaded yet
4. **Longer decision cycles** - Weekend leads may convert slower

### Projected Saturday ROI

**If Saturday's 3 quotes convert at typical 23.9% rate:**
- 3 quotes × 23.9% = **0.7 deals** (likely 1 deal)
- 1 deal × $3,395 avg value = **$3,395 revenue**
- Revenue vs Spend: $3,395 / $1,300 = **2.6x ROI** ✅

**Break-even Analysis:**
- Spent: $1,300
- Break-even needs: 0.38 deals ($1,300 / $3,395)

- CPA: $41.56
- Result: Below 20-call target

### Projected Performance at Different Bids

| Bid Adjustment | Est. Calls | Est. Spend | Est. CPA | Notes |
|---------------|------------|------------|----------|-------|
| -43% | 16 | $665 | $41.56 | ✓ Saturday actual |

---

## Budget Reallocation Analysis

### Current State (All 5 Campaigns)
- Boom Lifts + Loaders: $665 → 16 calls
- Scissor Lifts + Excavators: $617 → 0 calls

### Optimized State (Boom + Loaders Only)
- If Scissor + Excavator budget ($617) reallocates to Boom + Loaders
- New budget: $665 + $617 = $1,282
- Projected calls: ~31 calls (too many)
- **Solution:** Reduce bid to -30% to cap at 20-23 calls

---

## Sunday Strategy Recommendation

### Option 1: Full Test (Recommended)
**Setup:**
- Pause Scissor Lifts, Excavators, Dozers
- Run only Boom Lifts & Loaders
- Bid adjustment: -30%
- Expected: 20-23 calls at ~$900 spend (IF Sunday = Saturday)

**Monitoring Checkpoints:**
| Time | Expected Performance | Action if Below |
|------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 11 AM | 2-3 calls, $150-200 spend | Continue monitoring |
| 1 PM | 5-7 calls, $350-400 spend | Pause if <3 calls or CPA >$200 |
| 3 PM | 10-12 calls, $550-650 spend | Final decision point |

**Decision Rules:**
- ✅ Continue if: CPA <$100, getting 1+ call/hour
- ❌ Pause if: CPA >$200 by 1 PM, <3 calls by 1 PM

### Option 2: Conservative Test
- Same setup but -50% bid (lower than Saturday)
- Budget cap: $500
- Expected: 5-10 calls (test Sunday demand)

**Rationale for Full Test:**
- Historical data misleading (tested at -85% bid)
- Saturday at -43% bid outperformed historical average by 88%
- Need real data at competitive bid levels
- Manageable risk with active monitoring
